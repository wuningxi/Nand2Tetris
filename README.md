# Nand2Tetris 

This repository contains my solutions for the excellent Coursera course Nand2Tetris (https://www.nand2tetris.org/) which builds a modern computer starting from just Nand gates.

The project is structured into 12 weeks:

Part I: Hardware 

- [Boolean Logic](https://github.com/wuningxi/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/1)- build elementary logic gates (e.g. Not, And, Or, Mux, ...) from Nand gate
- [Boolean Arithmetic](https://github.com/wuningxi/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/2) - build HalfAdder, FullAdder, the ALU from elementary gates
- [Sequential Logic](https://github.com/wuningxi/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/3) - build sequential chips, Registers, RAM from elementary gates and DFF gate
- [Machine Language](https://github.com/wuningxi/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/4) - write low-level code in symbolic machine language, IO devices
- Computer Architecture: build CPU from RAM and ALU

Part II: Software 

- Assembler - Hack Assembler 
- Virtual Machine translator - Translate VM language into Hack assembly language 
	- Virtual Machine I - Stack arithmetic
	- Virtual machine II - Program control
- High-Level Language - Introducing Jack programming language and coding Tetris
- Jack Compiler - Jack Compiler 
	- Compiler I - Syntax analysis
	- Compiler II - Code generation
- Operating System - Jack Operating System or Standard library
